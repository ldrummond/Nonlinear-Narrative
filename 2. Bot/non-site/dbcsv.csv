"do your feet smell a lot?",436252328
"mmmm kinda",436252288
"i don’t really know",436252288
"certain brands will smell horrible after a few months while others don’t smell at all",436252358
"then theres things like whether you want slip on or lace up",436252369
"slip on or velcro for sure i think",436252378
"and then the shape of the shoe can be more tailored to bouldering or rope",436252379
"or overhang vs slab",436252384
"oh jeez",436252388
"specifics haha",436252395
ya,436252398
"usually climbing shoes wear down after about 6 mo to a year so you would probably get a beginner brand for now",436252438
"because its not gonna last until you get really good",436252446
"ya i think thats good",436252416
"so it doesn’t matter as much",436252451
"i don’t need like aggressive or anything",436252416
"ya thats what i was gonna say",436252465
"so often more aggressive shoes have more rubber covering and are more downturned",436252485
"a more aggressive shoe is more downturned so you can put more force on your toe,",436252504
"I’m into heels that are covered",436252514
"some of the rentals don’t and its awkward",436252520

"my shoes are completely covered which i really like cause i heel hook a lot",436252546
yeah,436252544

yess,436252668
"you also gotta see what shoes fit you the best",436252562
"mad rock is one of the cheaper more basic brands",436252592
"its pretty good",436252595
"but sometimes it smells",436252598
"the hard thing is theres no store that sells a ton of shoes",436252610
"the best is probably rei, but even rei only has a few brands",436252620

"ya i guess i should just try them on a lot",436253084
"it would be fun if a leader came too",436253089
"ya the other thing is make sure they fit right",436253098
"i think i got the feeling of correct fit down",436253145
"make sure it is not too cold when you get them, and maybe run a little before you try them on",436253145
"oh swell feet",436253153
"nice idea",436253155
"when you climb your feet swell up",436253156
"ya and depending on the weather the leather or synthetic in the shoes really changes size",436253173
"yeah when i was buying cycling shoes my dad told me not to run before trying them on",436253180
"also some shoes stretch and others don’t",436253186

"it's rly complicated right now ",442623232
"With you guys? Idk what to say. I like you a lot and always have fun with you, but I'm not so good at this kind of thing ",442623411
"I like you a lot too im just conflicted because I don't really know how you feel about whatever this is and I guess that's my fault too and I just never really figured out what I wanted in the long run and i didn't know if you cared about me hooking up w Jesse but now I realized either way it's not chill and me hooking w 2 ppl in general just doesn't work out ",442623969
"sry for the paragraph ",442623976
"I have a lot to say but I'm not doing a very good job",442623984
"I know it's hard to talk about this stuff. I thought I didn't care about you and Jessie, but at the party I felt like if I spent time with you and we hooked up, it wouldn't be fair to Jessie. But it was hard to see you guys together ",442624512
"I don't know what I want either",442624512
"I just like spending time with you",442624512
"ok ya that makes a lot of sense ",442624768
"I definitely do too and I'm glad you brought this us because it's good for us to talk about this ",442624768
"and like it's really easy for me to talk to you so I think we should just be honest ",442624896
Alright,442625920
"How do you feel about what we are doing?",442625920
"well I mean obviously I enjoy hanging out with you and also hooking up w you so I like what we are doing it's just like a bad time I think ",442627072
"What do you mean?",442627456
"because of Jesse ",442627712
"and ik it's my fault and I don't want it to become a thing where it's like picking between you guys I just haven't really been thinking about what I'm doing and didn't realized it could get so destructive ",442627712
"So you don't wanna hook up anymore",442627968
"I don't want to send you mixed signals bc it's hard for me bc I do really like you and when we hang out I want to hook up but I don't rly think it's a good idea rn",442628352
"if you wanna still hang out tho I'd def wanna do that ",442628352
"so basically I think we shouldn't right now and sorry if last night was annoying I feel bad and it was shitty ",442628480
"Well that fucking sucks. I guess I really didn't get how you felt",442628608
"fuck I know ",442628736
"I suck at this",442628736
"I didn't really know how you felt either though",442628736
"honestly I thought you didn't really care about me because when we first started talking about hooking and everything it seemed like you didn't ",442628736
"which wasn't necessarily bad I guess",442628864
"It wasn't bad that you thought I didn't care about you? ",442629248
"that's not what I meant ",442629504
"just like initially it was really casual and I was ok w that ",442629504
"Ya well that's my fucking problem. I can't keep hooking up with someone if I don't like them. I don't get the casual thing. It was casual at first, It's just the more time we spent together the more I liked you. And I was worried cause the last girl I started seriously hooking up with just fucked me over in the end. ",442629888
"I didn't want to like you too much but I guess I did",442629888
"And you always wanted it to be casual?",442629888
"no I have the problem ",442629888
"I started really liking you as well but I was worried you were only into having something casual",442630016
"what do u mean u didn't want to like me too much",442630016
"the same problem *",442630016
"you were like telling me that stuff about Abby and how you didn't like that she was emotional and so I didn't want to be that annoying emotional girl and I figured u just didn't really like me that much idk",442630016
"that's why I didn't think hooking up w Jesse would be an issue even though it's an issue for me in the first place to be hooking up w 2 people",442630144
"I always really liked you. I didn't want to like you too much because I'm used to urban people not actually caring about the people they hook up with, and I didn't want to feel shitty because I liked you more than you liked me and you decided to end it.  ",442630528
"And I thought that you and Jessie were kind of a thing ",442630656
"And I felt like I was sort of just on the outside. ",442630656
"I don't know why I said that about Abby. I didn't mean it ",442630656
"Honestly if you had said you wanted to date or something I probably would have said yes",442630656
"I had just given up on shit like that. The whole fucking hookup scene at urban just makes me feel like no one cares about each other",442630656
"ya I really understand that. I personally can't hookup with people for long periods if I don't like them and that's why it's been rly hard to figure out what's going on w me and Jesse because I think I care about him more than he cares about me and also I'm just trying to figure out if how I feel about him is just really me caring about him so much as a friend",442630784
"but anyways I guess I should have just asked you how you felt instead of just assuming ",442631040
"I'm just so stuck rn and its not fair for me to be putting you through that and ik this is like the classic thing to say but it's true and now that I know how you feel I feel even worse about this situation ",442631168

Do you feel connected to wash u staff (kitchen staff, cleaning staff, maintenance, so on)? 


If so, how connected do you feel? 



How would you want to get to know staff better?



Would you feel comfortable using those methods and have you used them? Have you tried to get to know staff?



Should Wash U take initiative in developing staff-student relations or should it be a purely student-led process?

"I'm worried that I'm gonna come back and you will be totally different. Not worried but just like, wondering if it's gonna be different to see each other again ",465689216
"I don't think it will. it's always been easy between us and it won't be hard for us to fall back into everything again, that might even be bad because it's always hard when u leave ",465689344
"Yeah I know we do get along easy, I don't know how much we will see each other though, and if that might make it easier or something",465690084

"aww good!! I want to cheer u up",465704064
"Yeah it helps",465704320
"i decided to go with the blue circle of the tattoo because my mom and keke think its better to just get a feeling for what its like to have a  tattoo before i commit to something with more content ",465704448
"and why do u need cheering up? whats wrong ",465704448
"Nooooo u got the blue!!!! I'm sure it looks awesome though! Send me a pic?! ",465704448
"i haven’t gotten it yet. keke is setting it up now",465704704

"and yeah in my house",465704704
"its not legal ",465704704
"Idk I feel like I'm not that close to people here and things are so different and shit just goes wrong",465704704
"Of course it isn't ",465704704
"I still really like the sailboat, I think it would be cooler ",465704704
"ah man. i want u to be happy there ",465704704
"You might not want another one, like don't just get one to practice ",465704704
"I am it's just different",465704704
"i do get a practice one. because if i decide i don’t like the circle i deff wouldn’t like something more complicated",465704832
"but i think ill get the sailboat on my bday when it is legal",465704832
"Ok but the circle is still there forever ",465704832
"yeah i know but I’ve been thinking about it for over a year",465704832
"It's up to you I know ",465704832
"and i just came up with the sailboat and i want more time to think about it ",465704832
"but i think i will get it",465704832
"Yeah I just don't want u to just follow what ur mom says cause she's totally covered in tattoos and I don't know if I see you like that ",465704832
"okay well I’m not gonna do that, but don’t be mean",465704960
"I'm not trying to be mean",465704960
"you don’t even like my piercings so i think we kinda have different ideas",465704960
"I do like ur peircings ",465704960
"i think its better to go with something simpler that i can change and add to later ",465704960
"I just feel like a tattoo is a commitment no matter what, and if ur doing one ur not sure about, like one you think you might change, then it might just be better to wait until u are sure or to get something ur more sure of ",465705088
"I’m very sure of the circle because i know that I’m unsure of the way i will feel about having something permanent on my body. i know that by having the ability to change it, that it will give me more peace of mind ",465705088
"one of the main things in getting a tattoo is that here and now i have my mom and I’ve been thinking about it a lot verus getting something impulsively once I’m 18 because i don’t know what its like to have something permanently on my body ",465705216
"i don’t know if any of that makes sense, but also where I’m getting it will be something that only i can see and i think i want the sailboat in a more visible place but i can do that until I’m 18",465705216
"I get it i just want to make sure you don't feel pressured into getting one, cause u do have plenty of time. Go for what you feel comfortable with ",465705344
"Definitely show me it when ur done I'm excited to see it",465705344
"i don’t feel pressure it took a lot of convincing to get my mom to say yes. it was over a year ago that i asked ",465705472
"and I’m exited too",465705472
"Yeah ok ",465706112

"yeah boi",470608702
"winter break? I’m also probably going to bishop ",470608715
"nice! christine told me that you might need me to coordinate a ride situation?",470608768
"yeah are you planning on driving back to st louis? ",470608802
yup!,470609657
"yeah i would totally be down to road trip back that would be really fun",470609673
"yeah! so I'm thinking about leaving hueco the 16th. get back in Dallas that night. stay the 17th in Dallas, then leave the 18th for St. Louis. 

OR I'm considering skipping that extra day in Dallas and just going straight to St. Louis from Dallas on the 17th and get in St. Louis at night. What would you prefer?",470609664
"idk, where is austin on the picture? on the way? cause id be down to check out austin too",470609807
"Austin is kind of out of the way but not too bad. if we wanna check that out, we'd have to leave hueco earlier.",470609792
"Is it nice to be back?",470613120
"its ok",470616143
"also I'm asking a rope for XMAS. how would you recommend me going about buying the rope that ensures the most safety and that is the best quality?",470623573
"oh yeah, idk id be down to see austin but also want to stay at hueco a while too ",470623598
"most safety and best quality",470623608
"haha how formal",470623612
"for the gym only? ",470623616
"outdoors and indoors",470623616
"ok so outdoors ropes you want longer and thicker generally",470623648
"some ropes have dry coating, thats to keep them waterproof outside",470623718
"unless ur doing ice climbing or mountaineering you don’t really need that",470623730
"ok does the term twin rope apply to the fact that the rope has two different stitching patterns and they switch at the halfway point?",470623744
"no thats called bi-pattern, twin ropes is where you half two ropes and you clip them into separate quickdraw lines to provide more safety on multi pitch routes ",470623822
"you want a dynamic single rope ",470623828
"ok thank you! also is 9 mm considered thick and is 70 mm considered long?",470623851
"70 m******",470623870
"around 10mm is average for outdoor thickness, and 70 m is generally the longest rope you can get, which is good because that means that it is long enough for any pitch bolted outside ",470623937
"9mm is fine",470623942
"gym ropes are around 10.3 i think, but they are static not dynamic and therefore can be thicker ",470623962
"my rope is 9.2 ",470623970
"so the thicker the rope is, the more static it is?",470624000
"not necessarily, most important thing is thinner ropes are lighter and often easier to clip into quick draws, but thicker ropes are somewhat stronger. Static ropes just mean that they don’t stretch as much to dissipate force, but that also means they are a bit stronger",470624149
"when you climb on a static rope, you are usually top roping and therefore putting less force on the rope",470624167
gotcha,470624256
"also if you wanted to spend some time in Austin I was gonna do that too but before going to hueco since hueco will generally be our last days of winter break",470628480
" oh ok ok",470637143
"￼",470677248
"Yo Lucas it's Nick - do you think I can come climbing tonight or would it be weird?",470704896

"yeah i get that. he was very different when i was hanging out with him 2 years ago then he was last year. i always tried to be there for him and he would let me for a little while before he pulled back. i feel like there wasn’t really anything any one person could have done tho which is sad ",470889344
"Yeah you were good for him but he missed the opportunity ",470889472

I had no idea the stories took up so little space. I made the armor because I found this passage in Ephesians called ""the armor of god"" and it talked about the breastplate of righteousness and all this stuff and I had wanted to maybe make clothing inspired by different women in the stories, mostly those without names, and I just realized that I needed to make this armor for these unnamed women ",477898496

"That's a shame. Like I say to everyone, please try to avoid this in the future.",478552192
"Also, I was a little gruffer then I meant to be about the trad thing. I just want you to know that, before Jake talked to me, I was not planning on banning Trad climbing, it really is about safety. I'd be happy to talk more about why I don't think distinguishing between sport and trad is arbitrary. It seems like we are cutting out bouldering too, which is Jakes call. Ultimately both are his call, but I am more able to enforce than he.",478552448
"I know all that, I understand the inherent risks and whatever. I also think that there is a better time to talk about what is allowed for us as a climbing team legally, and that our legal relationship with wash u is something that the group should understand and discuss as a whole",478553937
"I agree for the future, the issue is that right now it's basically too late to do anything about it, and for various reasons the issues would be exacerbated by widespread knowledge. Again, I can explain better in person",478554458

"I just remembered I have a meeting on Thursday from 8-8:30, just a heads up you might be alone for a sec",494911241
"That's fine",494913048
"For the team all it is is we carpool to the gym together (so ill first semester) every Tuesday and Thursday from 6:30 to 10:30, and you commit to going almost every practice. Without the team you can get to the upper limits downtown gym from the metro link train and it takes about 30 min. ",494914228
"So ill is also downtown but further away from the metro so harder to drive too ",494914271
"I mean metro too sorry",494914277
"Metro to. I can't speak ",494914285
"So we had almost 170 people sign up",494918723

"Yeah it's usually around a hundred",494919333

"Partially just to make it easier for us, would it make sense to charge the same for both gyms and not tell people why. Just 120 - 165",494962137
"It's not fair to the gyms. If upper limits is giving a better price than so ill why shouldn't our prices reflect that?",494962207
Idk,494962258

"Haha, so we have to make some kinda sculpture from metal, and I was thinking of using different chemicals to rust the metal and bend it to look like mushrooms and weird fungus things. No idea yet how I'm gonna do that... ",495576556
"Haha did you do other shots besides the one in the field? How are you guys doing them? It's cool that the whole class is learning something like that",495576592
"Yo make sure you're free this Sunday from 10am-2pm",495576787
"Haha that sounds awesome! I wish I knew how to sculpt things ",495577520
"And yeah I did other ones I think I showed you but they weren't as good because I didn't know what I was doing. The boob one was the field one! I also had to rebuild my hand. It's really lame because he's showing us all these interesting tricks that would have made my life way easier if I knew them at the time ",495577622
"How many sculpting classes have you taken? ",495577634
"Also I needed a letter of rec for an internship so I asked Adam for one and he wrote the nicest letter. I didn't know Adam even really attention to me haha  ",495577988
"*paid attention ",495578008
Why?,495586865
"Haha that's so nice though. I had the opposite today, I asked a teacher for feedback who I had talked to a bunch before and he didn't know my name. Haha it was the teacher that the illustrator at Annie's birthday knew!",495586961
"Yeah it's shitty when you have to rebuild things in photoshop too, never works that well. I don't remember boobs in that one? Send me the new levitation one when you are done I'm sure its gonna look cool ",495587013
"Just did a fun / weird photoshop portrait project ",495587036
"I've only taken one sculpture class, but I loved it. I really like working with my hands and all ",495587057

"How'd you get out of su this weekend",495590638
"The shadow of the rope and moon and head is great it creates depth. I would've made the hair a different color so that it could be complementary with the background. Because you hollowed out the top carabiners I would've also hollowed out the bottom ones. The arm looks fantastic especially because the part you chose seems like it outlines the center parts of a persons ear ",495590661
"Also the bird looks like a closed eye so that was a nice touch. But that could've been totally off I don't know that much! ",495590746
"All that stuff is great feedback you know what you are talking about. Wish you were in my classes, half the people never even talk during critiques. The hair I fucked around with a lot and couldn't really figure out. I gotta do something different with it but nothing's really working. ",495590986
"Who is everyone?",495591004
"It was fun but I'm not great at photoshop like I do a lot of stuff that sometimes ends up cool, but really I don't know what I'm doing",495591036
"Haha same! I get so frustrated and work on it for hours. The hair looks really good I think! Did you draw all of it on? ",495591124

"Haha yeah that saved the day",496018130
"I wanna hear your thoughts! Likes and dislikes..?",496018188
"It's really pretty, I love the colors, the dark red and green are very nice and the floating effect worked out really well ",496018993
"I think only thing I would change is making the surface of the water more visible so it's more clear what's she's floating over? Maybe, what do you think?",496019060
" Yeah I totally agree. The water was so hard to get in focus haha it was really hard to gage if we threw it at this speed in this direction, where would the camera catch it right in focus. And my shutter speed was to slow to make it sharp which I realized after I took the shots with my model in them ",496019675
"I think the editing went well though, that photo is 12 shots pieced together ",496019715

"But I'm getting his parents to send it ",496020872
"Haha no worries ",496026132
"Oh yeah the editing went really well. I zoomed in a bunch and saw a couple places where it's stitched together but those aren't at all noticeable unless really zoomed. What are you gonna do with it?! Also I just sat through the weirdest art lecture, it was all about the history of the sound of the human heartbeat, and how now they are putting heart implants into people that don't beat, but are continuously pumping. So those people have no pulse!!  ",496026349
"Idk there isn't really much to do with it! Haha yeah especially because when you zoom you can see so many mistakes. I'll learn though! And that sounds so cool what kind of art class was it for? And are those people alive? Haha like do they have souls..",496026838
"They don't have souls no",496026873
"What was this lecture for?",496026917
"Just for all the art school. There's this program where professional artists come and work with the printmaking faculty and make prints, then also give a lecture. He was that artist but didn't talk at all about printmaking so idk what it was really about, but it was pretty cool. Now I'm watching citizen Kane for my film class",496027053
"What are you up to?",496027057
"I just blasted music and tried cleaning my room but I got so frustrated with how many articles of clothing I have, so I started cleaning out my closet and now there are clothes all over everything. It's total madness. I just fled to yoga now haha I had to escape ",496027386
"So now I'm waiting for yoga and thinking about my messy life.",496027420
"What's citizen Kane all about? ",496027428
"It's about this wealthy newspaper owner who dies and a reporter who tries to understand his last words. It's supposedly one of the most revolutionary films ever made, with lots of filming effects and stuff. ",496027526
"Haha I still have clean laundry from Friday all over my bed thAt I don't wanna fold, I just piled it all over me last night when I went to bed",496027581
"Yoga sounds fun though I haven't done it in so long!",496027601
"Haha I could so picture that ",496027602

"Dude that class was so nice our instructor plays Sufjan Stevens and iron and wine stuff it's so nice ",496031682
"Aww now I'm locked out of my house haha ",496031979
"Oh no is no one home?",496033151
"Maintain your inner calm ",496033165
"That yoga class sounds so nice, I realized I haven't worked out in a long time I think that I need to start climbing again to feel good",496033202
"I feel like you're still super in shape",496033560
"And yeah I'm pretty sick and was just weak today haha it was so weird ",496033573
"Yeah that's the worst I'm just getting over being sick, nothing is appealing when you feel like that ",496033930
"Yeah idk if I'm out of shape I just feel a lot better when I workout",496033944
"Also I haven't been doing stuff that I really love that often, and climbing I always love and makes me so happy so I really need it",496033968
"I totally get you I haven't been doing the same. Like I haven't been on a hike this whole time ",496034319
"You should do what you love! Like try doing at least one thing everyday just because you want to ",496034342
"are you in studio?",496034630
"Fuck yeah go on a hike! You're lucky you have Bidwell so close it seems beautiful ",496034744
"No. What's up?",496034751
"You should go on a climbing trip soon! ",496034872
"Just wanted your opinion on something ",496034954
"Wanna call me or send me a pic?",496035350
"You should go on a hike!!",496035417
"I wanna hang out with you",496035423
"can I ask you out on a date sometime. It won't be for a while but I think it could be fun ",496035454
"Yes! I would love that. ",496035554
"Can we do something super rad? ",496035595
"Maybe you could get me flowers?",496035626
"Yeah il get you flowers for sure",496036083
"It'l be rad, wel go skydiving or something",496036097
"Haha yeah! We'll make out in the air. ",496036536
"But wait then I can't wear a dress. Maybe something else ",496036577
"Oh yeah that's fair, I've been wearing a kilt a lot lately so that's not gonna work",496036963
"I can't remember are you into exploring abandoned places and stuff like that?",496037034
Hahahah,496037077
"Yeah I love exploring! Just not when it's creepy and night time lol ",496037125
"Ya I think me too I told my campers a scary story about this underground bunker my friends and I explored and I think I saw a ghost",496037712
"What!! ",496038424
"Wait... Did that happen to you? ",496038438
"And hold up why did you ask about that? ",496038448
"Yeah it was freaky",496038470
"About what? If you like abandoned stuff",496038487
Yeah,496038509
"Idk cause I like that kinda stuff weirdly, also I can't really think of any other crazy date ideas",496038575
"I guess go to the movies",496038581
Haha,496038589

"I was thinking about that today I'm just always laughing when you're around  ",496039350
"Me too really",496039724
"But like so much more when we are together. I guess that's something I'm kinda afraid of, that if we just talk on the phone and text and not see each other for a long time, after a while I'm not gonna be able to make you laugh anymore. I know that's random but it's been in my head a little since I saw you",496039933
"Hmmm ",496040134
"Like you think I'm going to get bored of you?? ",496040159
"Nah! I don't think that! I just have so much fun with you in person, and I feel like I am not good at communication over the phone ",496040355
"Honestly part of it is my ex girlfriend and I had a really shitty long distance thing when I got to school, and It sort of fell apart over text and phone and stuff, and it really sucked to be so far away ",496040461
"Didn't mean to be a bummer 👻",496040480
"No you're not a bummer! ",496040802
"I appreciate you telling me this. Why do you think it fell apart? ",496040840
"She said she got lonely since I was gone, and started hooking up with this guy she had always been friends with, and I felt like it was because I couldn't make her happy over the phone",496041158
"I'm sorry that happened you didn't deserve that ",496041209
"It's ok it was a long time ago and I guess more complicated than that",496041360
"I miss you so much. and it would be so much easier if you were here. But the only thing that makes it better is talking to you! Whenever something good happens I want you to know all about it or whenever I'm feeling shitty I want to hear your voice. It doesn't matter if you feel like you can't communicate over the phone just as long as you are ",496041810
"I want to know everything you're thinking and I want to tell you all about my life haha I hope that's not annoying",496042052
"No it's really not annoying. I feel the same way, whenever I want to talk to someone you are the first person I think of, if I'm excited or sad like you said. I wanna talk to you always and will do my best, just let me know how you are feeling, I always wanna know what's really going on in your head",496042315
"Same to you! Seriously I want to talk to you all the time call or text me whenever you want to tell me something even if it's something small. It's hard not being physically with you but then I think about how happy I am that I met you and it's ok ",496043023
"I'm really happy I met you, I was not expecting to find you at camp you just came into my life out of the blue but it's dope. ",496043165
"I gotta go now, I'm getting a really bad headache and it hurts to look at my phone I need to sleep it off I think. But I wIll talk to you tomorrow and thanks for hearing me out on this stuff",496043248
"Yeah this is what it's all about listening to eachother ya know?",496043341
"Yeah sleep it off I'm sure it will feel better. Goodnight love ",496043412
"When do we have the underpass reserved?",496074733
"So are we just gonna not have practice this week?",496083815
"Did you read the email?",496084013
"Didn't get the email",496084413
"Nevermind weird it just showed up",496084453
"Hey, did you end up going to the presidents treasurers meeting?",496084672
"So which membership did Giles pay you for?",496084734
"Upper limits",496084889
"You're sure? I thought he signed up for climbing team",496084921
"Nope. That was an accident. ",496084973
"Aight so def uli then?",496085055
"Yes. Also, if you want help running the team you gotta keep me more in the loop in the future. I would have liked to be part of the team practice conversation. ",496085161
"Sorry I should have asked. I just figured you didn't want to do it any more since you haven't been super involved",496085359
"Basically because I missed the president meeting. ",496085674
"I was there for dues collection. ",496085689
"I just want to make climbing team happen, and make it accessible for new students and new climbers. I don't care what position I play, but both you and nicki will be gone eventually and then someone has gotta make it happen. ",496085755
"Yeah I did, fairly long and pointless ",496087829
"Yo thanks for doing that man!",496087850
"But Jake says he wants to show us how to deposit the money on Thursday, are you available? ",496087853
"I appreciate I",496087853
"No problem! Are you fine with being sort of co-presidents here? I'd like to be more involved with the climbing leadership, so next semester or next year maybe one of us could be treasurer and the other would be president ",496087911
"I think it would be easier to get shit done as well ",496087922
"Yeah man that sounds excellent. I don't care what role I am I just want the climbing team to exist and support new members! ",496087964
"Same thing here. Does sometime Thursday work to deposit for you? ",496087999

"Hey jake and Robin. So we gotta get fall break figured out so people can make plans. Jake, robin and Dakota are leading a beginner/intermediate trip to the red, through OC but potentially taking climbing team members who aren't climbing 10s or leading. It makes sense if everyone stays at Linda's and then split up for meals and climbing and stuff. ",497810102
"Idk how much funding oc has, but if some of climbing club are trying to go to the red and Robin and Dakota are gonna help them climb, it would make sense for us to help fund ",497810163
"Robin, you guys are going through with that? Why aren't you going to HCR?",497810190
"I think cause they wanna go to the red",497810289
,497810372
"Good luck on your test today",497810342
"Yea and I think it'll be easier to coordinate with cc and we had planned on going to the red and the peoples we've talked to seem more interested in heading there ",497810421
"I think OC is sending out an email today with similar questions to gauge experience and gear that students agave who want to go on the trip so once we have that it'll be easier to see what numbers would look like and how many cars we will have and when ppl want to leave and such, we were planning on leaving a little later (Saturday) and coming back Tuesday so it'll be a shorter trip than cc by a little and we can organize rides there and back based on seats and preferences ",497810980
"I'm down but Mike was talking about just going to the red",497811003
"Yeah... I just imagine chilling by the lake, crack climbing all day, fishing and swimming ",497811045
"Sounds good",497811074
Thanks,497811078
"Ok. HCR is still way better for beginners though",497811348
"Yep but this way everyone gets to hang out together which is a positive",497811375
"It just seems kind of silly to run two trips to the same place",497811509
"Same. Maybe Greg would be down",497811515
"Why? OC has already been to HCR this semester, and they are going to be climbing different stuff at the red",497811599
"It's a similar trip just also open to beginners and climbers that aren't as strong or weird hiking kids who wanna learn about rocks ",497811713
"Every time we go to the red, we split up into small groups based on ability level anyway",497811722
"The climbing club trip is also open to everyone",497811737
"Haha love the weird rock kids",497811737
"Yes and no. The qualification of climbing harder than 5.10 outside is actually pretty restrictive towards a lot of club members",497811787
"And it sounds like no one on the climbing club wants to set up a lot of 5.8 5.9 5.10 top ropes",497811818
"Yeah greliot would probably come ",497811832
"It was a suggestion, that did not stop many people who climb under 5.10 from signing up. It is also not really my restriction, but rather the restriction of the place we are going",497811853
"I'm down for either, but if we go to Devils lake lets try and get some club money",497811867
"And if some of them wanna come with us and climb easier things or set up top ropes they can:) i figure we will do the same thing as you planned via splitting up by ability level regardless of if they sign up through OC or cc ",497811930
"I don't think it's necessarily a negative thing to have more people who are experienced leading trips  coming to the red and bringing those who are open to learning and may be just starting climbing. I know from our last trip too that there are definitely people who aren't on the climbing club who are either interested in starting or have been climbing outdoors for a while who would love to come ",497812089
"For planning purposes it might be easier if everyone filled out the same form? I can share the responses with you guys",497812719
"Are you getting camping gear from outing club?",497812731
"Yep camping gear will come from outing club ☺️ ",497812755
"That'd be sweet! My gmail is rlinzmay@gmail.com",497812775

"Head? ",497812827
Gear,497812848
"Probably depends on what kinda gear because oc also has a canoe trip going out, but the best bet is to ask mike Heavner or Nathan Walton because they run gear things ",497812905
"But yea they'll help with as much gear as possible regardless of how ppl sign up depending on what's available ",497812942
"We have tents for like 6 or 8 people but 16 people are signed up. Also short 3 sleeping bags and 2 sleeping pads so far",497813051
"Alrighty I'll see how many ppl sign up through OC, see what the totals look like and we will of course bring as much gear as possible ",497813204
"We can also try to snag from friends extra stuff ",497813217
"Yeah I was talking to mike, wel share as much of the climbing gear and camping gear to make the trip happen",497813279
"Aight. Robin did you get the link?",497813308
"Yep! Is there any chance I can add a couple questions and rewrite the top part for OC? Some of the logistics might be a little different ",497813442
"Um yeah you can generalize the top bit",497813506
"We can also make a nearly identical one with the changes and share the results with you that might be easier ",497813512

"all kinds of things, we want a group that can work together well and make as many people feel comfortable, but also that has the skills and stuff to make the trip happen.",498763873
"my biggest things are if they are thinking about how they can help others rather than what they might get out of it for themselves, and if they are good at asking questions and listening",498763914
"Yeah I feel like those are the most important qualities to have forsure. Do they have to answer long. essay questions about themselves?",498764278
"its like a lot of different questions, weird ones but trying to get them to share stuff",498764309

"i honestly wanna hear about every moment of your trip. Gotta say I’m jealous, it sounds pretty amazing. What mountain? That sounds unreal. Here I’ve been climbing a lot which is great, Ive gotten outside almost every weekend since I got back, and WP was a great way to start off the year. Classes are definitely interesting, especially community building and film studies is pretty cool. Im not as present as I would like to be, though. I think I want to be outside / traveling more but its still pretty early in the year so I have to get used to being here.",498767422
"yeah it would be creepy but awesome. whats the essay about?",498769110
"I see I see. Yah she's a fun gal ",498769616
"It's what I told you a little about yesterday. Basically about how our capitalist system constantly tells us what we need to consume to be happy but we never question consumption and the fact that that might not make us truly happy. And I'm tying that to the idea of love and how we treat it as a commodity, something we want to have but don't actually feel.",498769923
"It's confusing but is going to make sense haha it's based on critical theory and I felt really smart when I came up with the thesis but it's really hard to put into words ",498770062
"i included the circle reminder on both emails!!",498770492
"you’re great never mind then I guess he is just a goof",498771124
"what did you write for the thesis",498772596
"it makes sense",498772598
"Our capitalist system has disguised love as an entity we need to have, but not feel, which caters to an ongoing cycle of loneliness in modern day society. ",498773420
"Hey I was thinking of renting a car to catch up to practice tomorrow after interviews- would you wanna come?",498773724
"yeah id be down",498773849
"very interesting, i get that, like what is love really? was there love before media designed a stereotypical love?",498773880
"what do you think about our love then? ",498773892
"Well I thought about you a lot while wetting this actually! ",498774138
"Car is rented 👍🏼",498774165
"yeah what’d ya think",498774300
"There are all these trivial rules to  ""having a relationship"". Like you are supposed to be older than me, we're supposed to bond over consumer items like things we spend money on, and we never bonded over any of that haha ",498774313
"Or here's something I really thought of, i was texting you and someone was like oh do you have a boyfriend? And I couldn't say yeah. I was like yeah his names Lucas, I'm super in love with this guy he's so rad and I kept describing you haha ",498774489
"haha yeah i get that",498774503
"idk i think theres more too it too",498774510
"And like I realized Someone you love can't be explained with one word. And I find it so crazy that everyone in a relationship always only settles to describe their person with one word. As if it's something they have that can be compared to every other person in a relationship ",498774564
"like deeper, i feel like relationships have this strange complexity i really don’t understand. I have no idea how to explain how I feel about you, not just because I care about you but because I really wonder if two people can actually understand each other, like because people are so different even in how they perceive the world",498774580
"yeah i think thats similar to what I’m thinking",498774600
hype,498774603
"Yeah!! Haha it's really crazy because it is so relevant to these theories I'm learning in my class.  ",498774628
"And yeah like I don't want a relationship, I want you. And so many people just think that having a 'relationship' will make them happy. Which is centered around shit that society (media)  tells us will make us happy! ",498774837
"Haha do you bring up us in class a lot?",498778122
" I lowkey totally did when we were discussing the dude I'm writing my paper on. I talked about what I just told you and We had such a good talk about it haha. It was really rad actually my professor and everyone in the class kept asking me questions I kinda led the discussion that day ",498778884
"Wow idk if that's gonna weird you out or not haha sociology gets personal sometimes ",498779026
"Haha I'm like your experiment damn ",498779043
"Haha no you're not ",498780629
"I sociologically analyze everything :) lol",498780649
"Any plans for the weekend? ",498780664
"I think it's this law grad student drew",498787775
"Okay someone left their phone in my bag last night and your number is in their phone so I called you. Let me know who the missed call is from!!",498786604
"Or maybe he just called me",498787795
"When did you see him last night? ",498787786
"Wait you just called me?",498786621
"Hey what's up?",498787336
"Who's phone was it?",498787728

"I texted it did you get it?",498787763
"Ugh this guy",498788247
"He put his phone and car keys in my bag",498788255
"And now I have to go back to so I'll",498788260
"Thank you for your help!!",498788264
"Wait what happened?",498788285
"Actually pretty funny. I was at soill with my girlfriend, and while she was tying in i went and put my keys and phone in her bag. Only it was actually someone else's bag. ",498792284
"And that person left before I realized",498792293
"I guess she realized and tried to use voice control to figure out whose it was",498792341
"And amazingly, it called you. The only name in my phone she could possibly recognize, because she's on the washu climbing team. ",498792368
"I forget her name but her boyfriend, if that's what he is, is nathan ",498792383
"It was Erin ",498792505
"I don't think she's dating Nathan ",498792518
"That's crazy that she got it",498792524
"I know. And lucky she was willing to come straight back",498792553
"Because I drove, and she ended up with my phone AND keys",498792567
"We were stranded at soill for an extra 45 min. ",498792577

2.TELL THEM WHO YOU ARE - “It’s [insert name here], from WP steering” OR if you’re super excited and wanna jump the gun you could say “I’ll be your steering- congratulations you’re a WP leader!!!” 
3.If you’re a calm mother fucker and you chose not to do the latter, feel free to tell them that they made the leader group at this point in the phone call. “You’re a WP leader [insert expletive of choice here]!!!” 
4.Tell them that EMAILS are coming out within the next hour and to please not speak of this to anyone until that hour - “because you’re friends might get a phone call/email after you and we don’t want to ruin the surprise.”
5.Tell them to look out for a GEAR LIST in that email - super important. “you will freeze your tits off if you do not have winter camping gear.” 
6.Tell them to respond to that email saying that they accept - “we would like it IN WRITING that you have accepted the responsibility of being a WP leader”
7.If they have any questions they can call you or any of us (we can include our numbers in the email?) over break. 
8.The FIRST SUPER SECRET MEETING will be on Tuesday 17th - very important - clear your schedule - look out for more emails. “CHECK YOUR EMAILS”

We have a doc in the drive under MTGS & TRNGS called SS1: Logistics if you want the nitty gritty details. We were thinking that we would have non-steering members of our leader group be the drivers that would guide their blindfolded groups to their cars and drive them to the park. Steering would be at the park already and would be communicating with all the drivers getting updates and answering questions and setting up the tarp shelter. Alternatively we could have one or two steering be drivers too. With the current bottom liners, which aren’t totally set in stone, that would be Steph and Willie that we could have be drivers if they wanted to. Would you guys be okay with having all the drivers be non steering peeps from our leader group?

If they do i don't view it as a huge deal they likely will not know everyone anyway. Like in theory it's nice if it's a surprise but I don't think it ruins a lot. Also I feel if we reveal the list after break the leaders are more likely to be hype about and want to show the new leaders whereas now they can process it and be chill. Just another perspective, I don't really care that much but like it's caused some weird tension in wpoppers. I see value in both waiting or not idk ",504838276

3. in a more general sense i was thinking it could be cool if old leaders played more of a part or something until handoff so that new leaders could know old leaders. so they probably wouldn't be inside the circle but maybe there was a larger circle around the new leaders of old leaders or something idk",504912549

And each time you toss a warmup pitch, they do these sound effects timed with the ball going between the pitcher and the catcher. It’s like a loud whoooop when you throw the ball, and then a wooooo when the catcher throws it back. As an opposing player, I can tell you for a fact that it’s super annoying. But at the same time, I always respected it because those fans have the whole thing down pat — it’s done in perfect unison. And it’s every single time.

Give her dates.

Usually I say Feb 1 (day after fall membership stops) until like a day or two after graduation (May 20 or 21 this year). Then I have it reactivate for the period between a few days before the fall semester starts (Aug 26 or 27 this year) and about a week after the fall activities fair.

Also give her a price -- the same as last semester. I believe it was $160 for csi last semester.

Make sure you plug your desired dates into wolfram alpha to make sure it doesn't exceed 4 months by more than like a day or two, otherwise they'll charge us more.

Also specify that we are looking for premium memberships.

Same thing for upper limits, except gold memberships instead of premium memberships. Also their price was $150 instead of $160. We are also looking for access to The Boardroom (the after hours training zone at west county). Also try to get us permanent access to the chesterfield gym (they might want more money for that. If that's the case, try to get it to $160 so it's the same price as so ill. That will make your lives a lot easier)",506553270

Please plan carefully as you have a relatively short amount of time. We are looking to see your ability to plan a group lesson or activity and carry it out effectively. What you lead does not have to be something that you would do on an Overland trip (although it could be).

They were talking about how they don't want to give us much money because they don't like how the club is pretty much just for subsidized memberships and they ""don't fund giveaways."" I'm pretty sure we were already aware that that's why they keep underfunding us but they also were saying that if it were just the team or if the club was more organized, they'd give us a lot more money. I really think we should rethink how the club works. Like we should either merge it with the team, get rid of it or make it more organized (e.g. If you're driving you have to post in a club groupme to offer to drive other people). It's probably too late to do anything this semester but if we want more money we really should consider marking changes for next semester",507590286

"That's an interesting question! ",507787515
"Hmm ",507787521
"I do get bored sometimes, but I really try to not get bored because being bored for me is a pretty bad thing. Being bored for me isn't when I'm doing something that is generally boring, but it's doing something that leads to me feeling like I'm not being productive for others or for myself. So lying on a couch all day after a super long week feels productive sometimes because I need to restore my physical or emotional wellbeing. But when I don't feel like I'm gaining any fulfillment out of doing something, that's when I get bored. And that's when I get depressed.   ",507788225

"haha i was thinking about whether or not you got bored, because I feel like getting bored is one of my weaknesses, and I get bored usually when I don’t socialize so its kinda my fault. But it always seemed like you have a plan for every day, and were good at making plans with friends",507850015
"its just interesting to think about, and I was kinda wondering if we would ever get bored together",507850071
"i mean maybe bored together but not bored of each other ya know? ",507850083

"And thanks! Yeah I'm sometimes not good at planning things for myself but when things have to do with seeing people, I kinda automatically work hard to make sure I can see them. But that's because I care about socialization a lot and it makes me super happy ",507853560

"haha ok that honestly sounds good",509604328
"is this too much of a stretch? Although Kakei includes enough traditional stylistic elements to clearly define Hachiman as a deity, by choosing to present the Shinto idol in the form of a Buddhist priest Kakei argues that Shinto’s culture significance has become dependent on its compatibility with Buddhism.

"Moab has zero sport. It’s all trad and bouldering. 5 hours from st george.",509605894
"Tbh, moab is probably too hard for all of us except you haha. But we could take a car up for 2 days from st george.",509605979

"go to indian creek, drive 15 min to canyon lands and do slot canyons all day",509606009

"idk maybe we do more moab research?",509606801
"or we go southeast?",509606806

"what is southeast?",509606834
yeah,509606836
"chatt, horse pens... idk what else",509606849

"also, if not many of the really new people sign up, we could maybe manage moab area. I’m thinking people like paige who barely top rope could just follow us up easy trad.",509606967
"yeah maybe",509607080
"i think if we do moab we have to find other solid sport walls, and spend a few days doing sport and maybe a day or two doing trad",509607104
"other days can include... repelling off looking glass, canyoneering in canyon lands, exploring arches, getting drunk with Beta and OC’s spring break groups, and so on",509607147

"not sure,",509607942
"yeah that’d be sick",509607946
"i guess look at wash u rentals, maybe passenger van rentals? also renting a small uhaul trailer for all the gear could save space for sure",509607971
"I’m gonna replace red rocks with southeast",509608173
"People might be interested in red rocks ",509608214

"Yeah same thing happened to me",509997516
"I was under the impression we used that for something else",509998141
"But if we didn't and we didn't file a request for that particular money to carry forward then yes unfortunately it disappears ",509998176
"Pretty sure we aren't that dumb though. I'll take a look",509998201
"Jake, I asked you about this last semester and you said it carries forward automatically. ",509998214
"Nah no way I said that.... If we don't file a carry forward request we lose it",509998354
"Unless I misunderstood what you were asking at the time",509998369
"The only account that carries over is fundraising ",509998385
"You definitely did actually. Because I kept trying to buy ropes and you were like, no rush",509998388
"Damn cause I was under the impression you were buying the ropes",509998435
"I have never been the treasurer. I tried to get a credit card request filed in the last weeks of last semester, and you werent worried about it. It's gonna make planning spring break a lot harder without ropes",509998510
"We have plenty of people with ropes for break",509998546
"I have one, we could prob borrow Madeleine's, Greg has two or three, Eliot has one",509998607
"How many people are trying to come?",509998622
"Greg has two half ropes",509998623
"Doesn't he also have a single?",509998640
"This is a big deal man, that also means we aren't gonna get funded for it for next semester eairher",509998645
Either,509998649
"Didn't we get like $300 for something like guidebooks? Could we reappropriate some of that?",509998777
"Reappropriating was part of what fucked our budget this semester",509998829
"That was across accounts though",509998842
"Spending money we got for one gear on other gear might be allowed",509998860
"Since ropes are definitely more import than guidebooks and they gave us $320 for it",509998882
"Plus $80 for a whisper lite and we don't need two colemans super bad until I bounce, so we could get one now and there's another $70",509998952
"But we should ask someone about that, appeals might be stricter",509998968
"We have 1322 in fundraising we could dip from for ropes",509999802
"I'm sorry guys it sounds like I made a mistake or we had a bad miscommunication or both",509999852
"Only $300 of the $444 was for ropes",509999934
"Yeah they're super cheap from you and me ",509999995
"haha ur good, did you figure out the bb stuff yet?",510000014
"Maybe it's a dumb question, but might it be snowing there now? ",510000044
"haha not stupid, it might be now, but it looks like the weather gets a lot better mid march",510000072
"as is though, we are counting on the weather getting good. If theres a big storm, we’l probably go farther but we could pick u up",510000107
"According to spring break sign up thing we have 8 ropes",510000335
"Counting the doubles as one rope",510000345
"For 15 people that is doable",510000383
"Should we get in touch with team alumni to see if they want to meet up with us during spring break. Like I bet Christine would be able to ",510001009
"Yeah and I could always stay in a hostel for a night or something if I have to get there a day or two earlier then you guys ",510001188

"We’re all good with bear bucks. I spoke to the person in charge, and she is literally just waiting for the go ahead from a different body to deposit the money. I gave her the receipts and she said everything checks out, and “just spend the money like you have it” ",510167828
"oh ok chill, thats a relief, did she say how much it was?",510167848
"Apparently its normal for it to take a little while before we see it in our account ",510167849
"3000 and something ",510167859
"The concrete installation is free but the aluminum abd Robert Irwin stuff isn't open yet and is $5 for students. Im at Chinati ",510167860
"whew thats what it should be, and that means we should have 6 or 7 hundred extra in the account which will be a good backup for the trip",510167904
"but can we a rent a car even though it wasn’t budgeted specifically? ",510167923
"It seems like we would be able to if we just work with Cynthia ",510167956
"ok, then we have to find out how much it costs to rent thru SU vs michael’s scheme haha",510167992
"chinati is awesome though, thats the coolest place",510168028
"Ha exactly. Will we need one even if we have Nathan’s car? ",510168088
"Real cool. Irwin doesn't open till 3 and we can't stay that late :( looks like it would be awesome though ",510168108
"We drove past the prada store yesterday. You been here before ?",510168581
"￼",510168682
Yeah,510168834
"Right? Cause we have Paige, Steph's, Nathan's, but we need 4",510168862
"Yeah you're right ",510169032
"Should I tell Nathan to buy his plane ticket?",510169130
"We probably can't afford to buy his. But we can cover his food and camping while he's with us.",510169193
"Also, since our budget is in the red, should we consider collecting money before the trip?",510169237
"Wait that doesn't really make sense. Nvm on collecting money.",510169423
Yay!,510169926
"Let's not go too overboard with reimbursing Nathan. Although he's only going to be there half the time and is paying to fly out, he's still getting food and we're paying for gas to drive back. We definitely should reimburse him some money but not as much as people whose cars were using who are not going ",510169993
"Yeah I get that, but we arent reimbursing people who are driving and coming for using their cars",510170135
"If he came, he would be paying around 40 for camping and food",510170157
"We will waive that 40, and if we can, add a little more if that helped to cover his flight",510170184

"What class is it? ",510172825

"it doesn’t help that the class sounded really interesting but just ended up not being interesting at all",510172853

yeah,510172993

"i think I’m just gonna forget it all soon",510173951
"hmm try to find one thing that's interesting each class? ",510174458
"yeah i know but her email was like, you have to do better than excellent from now on to pass this class, and I’m like what the fuck kind of participation do you expect? ",510174507

"Hey do you guys have gear from the last trip? Can you bring it by my place?",510180870
"I think we should start collecting everything today. In my apartment maybe.",510180880
"And if you're gonna order stoves and tents and coolers, do it today",510180893
"Yeah ok ",510180907
"I think gear would be easier here cause a lot is already over here",510180921
"We can split it up tho",510180931
"Hey Greg happy birthday!!!",510180949
"Ok I just have a lot of space but if you do, that's fine",510180954

"I should have enough",510180983
"wait one sec I'm thinking",510180996

5p?,510181177
Yeah,510181183
"Ask Eliot if he's ok getting there at that time",510181205

"Before is fine too. Like 6?",510181299
"So I'm leading a WP trip this weekend and we are gonna try and set up top ropes at the Johnson shutins, and I need to build anchors. Could I borrow a few trad pieces? No worries if not, I could figure something out",510181316
"Yeah sure that's hreat",510181324
"Great ",510181327
"I think he should get it, it's by far the cheapest",510181364
"Alright go for it",510181391
"Sure. I'd drive over that morning and we'd drive back in the evening ",510181394
"He knows he's only gonna get to climb a day or two max right!",510181402
"That works",510181397
"？",510181406
"I have a theory",510181451
"That they might stay in boulder and climb there so they don't have to drive back",510181472
"Also if the weather is good we should all drive back to boulder",510181492
"Yeah that'd be perfect",510181518
"This is stressful af. ",510181778
"Nah we good!",510181791
"What's up?",510181794
"I deal with this shit all the time with wp",510181810

"do u have a thesis for this one yet?",510182744

"do u have a thesis?",510182908
"yeah, basically that by presenting a single figure instead of the whole entourage an individual can feel more connected to the figure ",510182949
"is that visual analysis-y enough?",510182957

Then 'I really want to go on the trip this weekend but I have to prioritize school and I don't think I can miss all Saturday up to 3 on Sunday. Also I'm not in great health and these trips always take a lot out of me because I didn't know anyone coming in and I feel like I have to work harder than most people at the social aspect of WP. Everyone's amazing and welcoming but I'm not close with anyone and I feel pretty isolated most of the time, which can be exhausting and stressful.
What's your suggestion? I don't think I should go, but I'm really not avoiding responsibility. I just know I need to prioritize my health and school. And i won't gain anything from the trip if I'm sick and stressed.

"How much money?",510721909
2100,510721918
"Based on my quick estimation just now the trip will cost under $3k",510721963
"Assuming 500 for the car and $75/night camping",510721976
"We did calculations, it's not gonna bee that cheap",510721982
"lucas, we can make back the money in moab on blm. It’s less than 10/night for a campsite",510722015
"no BS parking costs",510722020
"That's true, where would we camp if we end up in boulder? That's more expensive right?",510722050
"yeah. no camping near the city. you have to go to the state/national parks which will undoubtedly be freezing",510722074
"i don’t think we have many better options in st george",510722116

"4 cars driving 3500 miles each total, 10/day/person for food, 5/day/person for camping",510722198
"I'm not using it, but the appeal we wrote for spring break has the cost at 5300",510722220
"Camping is way over, but still",510722230
"plus rental cars",510722232
"Yeah that doesn't include rental or paying to borrow cars",510722249
"St George cost 1800 last year",510722391
"Red Rock cost the same two years ago, 1800",510722411
"So add 500 for a rental car and that's how much it should cost this year, right?",510722439
"Idk I'm skeptical about both estimates. I think we'll be okay either way",510723203
"We do have a couple of thousand extra dollars in the fundraising account that we can use as a cushion if necessary",510723245
"not really",510723257

"might have several hundred but shouldn’t count on it",510723278

"How significant are the differences in camping costs?",510723300
"Less than 75 probably",510723384
"Seems to me like Quail Creek is $4/night more than Snow Canyon, assuming everyone is in a single site at Quail Creek",510723388
"I for sure think snow Canyon group site is cheaper",510723429
"ok well lets see if we can get it with our size group being smaller,",510723455
"I’m not specifically worried about the price of camping just want us to be careful because we don’t know when something might cost more",510723492
"We have 5 cars, it's going to look like there are a lot of us",510723493
"but camping at snow canyon would be cool",510723498
"They say max 6 cars",510723498
"Not sure if my exam gets out at 1 or 1:30 but I will let u kno",510723579
ok,510723592
"I am overestimating everything from the rental car to the price of gas to food cost and I can't get it to go over $3500. I think we're going to be alright with the $2100 + collected money",510723702
"Really I think we're going to be alright just 3 or 400 extra on top of the 2100",510723736

Because it seemed like 4 people wasn't gonna work, I talked to someone at the coop cause I knew they were doing applications, and I got accepted for a spot there next semester. so you guys don't have to worry about the apartment. Kinda bummed cuz I was really excited to live with you guys, but I think the coop will be a lot of fun too. Also it's a semesterly thing, so if it turns out we can do 4 people, maybe I can move in second semester. But yeah - that cool with you guys? Obviously I'd love to still hang out at the apartment and you guys are definitely welcome at the coop all the time. ",511754523

"Choosing Groups

Be very conscious of relationships! If they are dating or best friends DO NOT put them in the same trail group!

Think about for TGs:
1 person who’s very positive
1 person who’s a doer
1 person who has great people skills (empathic)
gender balance is helpful (if you can)
1 person with a strong attention to detail (sometimes comes with doer)

Ask the why first!
Who's paying for it?
Who made this decision?
We have willing Alums, can they fulfill this requirement?
Especially if it's Stan/ Amy, they should be paid.
What training should they have? More than the medical training that we have?
What is the requirement? Over 21? WFR? University employee?

Is this decision coming from somewhere? Are you worried about safety? Sat phones?

Do pre O freshmen fill out debrief surveys? Can we see those?",512665800

Have them send as many invoice as they have for now and we can figure out how to distribute the money later. Then we also want to reimburse people who drove but didn't rent car shares. Let me know if you have a better idea, but how I think we should do that is have them fill up their car a couple times over the next week, and give us their gas receipts from those fill ups ",513135570
"No, I don't, I'd say get people to motivate. Like set a hard deadline of Friday or Monday or something, and talk to gen because she figured out last semester how to get carshare invoices",513135656

"yeah thought so",514405328
"what about volumes though? made of wood, thats probably way cheaper",514405340
"would there be a way to make all the holds out of wood?",514405354
"Ya you can make them out of plastic though. Volumes that is",514405711
"You can but wood is harder then foam/plastic",514405724
"Also more expensive",514405727
"Harder to work with",514405736

"yuck fuck the babies",514405826
"Most wood holds are made of layered glued wood",514405840

Huh,514405889
"do you have some of your 3d printed holds available?",514405900
Ya,514405904
"also 3d printing is way more expensive than casting right?",514405911
"so i have an idea to give them texture",514405920
"i don’t know what condition its in, but there is a sandblaster at the art schoo",514405944
"Ya but you can cast the 3d prints",514405964
"I think it would eat through it too fast",514405974
"i wonder",514405982
"I read that people mix sand and paint ",514405982
"it’d be worth a try, sandblasting is pretty easy and quick",514405995
"can i test one out?",514406001
"Wouldn't it just make it smoothing too",514406059
"It needs a very rough texture",514406067
"it depends on the coarseness of the sand",514406081
"Plus I feel like it needs to have bits sticking out not in if you get what I mean",514406087
"It needs extra material or less",514406093
"For the type of texture",514406097
"Not less",514406101
"yeah, I’m interested to see though",514406113
"We could try",514406113
"also depending on the quality of the 3d printer, we could larger textures like bubble wrap texture",514406150
"I don't think that's very realistic",514406182
"Oh like bubble hold sort of things",514406198
"Ya that could work",514406201
"I thought you meant textures",514406206
"I was thinking of how to print textures like overheating it so it bubbles but I doubt it would work lol",514406228
haha,514406255
"no like ",514406256
"￼",514406279
Ya,514406285
"We could do that",514406293
"I still think sand and paint",514406299
"Or sand and resin",514406305
"That would also save resin ",514406311
"Also btw I found someone who scanned a boulder at Yosemite and made it into a hold",514406409
"This gave me the idea",514406413
"Can we scan and 3d print routes so we can figure out the beta/set similar indoor routes ",514406439
"OH thats a cool idea building routes that model outdoor boulder problems",514406444
"They literally made the entire boulder into a hold though",514406460
"or just set exact replicas of famous outdoor boulders...",514406465
"haha what",514406472
"thats weird",514406475

"Wp climbing?",516653651
Why?,516653664
"Yeah of course, but there ain't that much too them to be honest",516653714
"No like climbing team ",516653768
"Because we need a grad student or employee of the college to be at base camp",516653784
"I asked Carlo lol",516653792
"Haha yeah I know you guys do, I would try reaching out to wp alums first ",516653831
"You don't necessarily want someone there who has no idea what's going on",516653846
"Have you guys been talking to Stan and Amy about the whole alum thing?",516653878
"Because last we met about it, it's more complicated than just having any alum there",516653926
"Leaders are trying to find an alum to be at base camp for their trip, did we ever tell them they needed to do that? Cause they are just looking for any wash u alum not even wp people necessarily, and that sounds v different from when we met with Stan and Amy and Andrea ",516654019
"Right yeah it can't just be an alum it has to be a grad student or employee ",516654033
"Yeah Stan is coming in a few hours ",516654042
"Oh ok ",516654056
"I was just wondering if u could think of any grad students on climbing team that we could ask",516654068
"Oh ok never mind they are looking for grad students",516654071
"But just random, non-wp grad students which seems weird",516654097
"Ok so I'm down for whenever, the weekend of the 27th and 28th is Memorial Day weekend but if we are already camping by then it shouldn't matter, so we go up from 24 to 29? 30? I have to be back the 2nd for a lifeguarding course, but otherwise am free forever ",516654471
"Sounds good. Let's just plan for 24-29. We can always stay longer if we want.",516654760
hype,516654777
"￼",516654843
"wanna give me a lil synopsis ",516655186
Yep,516656610
dope,516656619
"stan is talking with us right now",516656664
"so can’t talk on phone!",516656667
"but i’ll let you know once that’s over and can call you if you’re free",516656677
"K no worries I can text it to you",516656684
"pay attention to stan ya dingus! ",516656715
amazing,516656738
"Hey, did you hear about res life forcing oc to move the gear closet? ",516657138
"yeah thats bullshit wtf",516657162
"I'm going to go with the oc people and Stan to meet with Rec sports to ask about space in the AC ",516657238
"of course they wait until we are all gone to tell us so there is nothing we can do about it",516657251
"Since presumably we'll have to move the climbing closet too ",516657258
"does it seem like there is nothing we can do to stop them? because we need those places",516657274
"fuckers! ",516657280
"yeah the climbing closet probably too",516657288
"Yeah luckily I'm here with WP and Stan ",516657277
"Hannah, Noah, Sonia, Stan and I are gonna meet with rec sports to get the deets",516657354
"If we can work out an acceptable arrangement, are you cool with the climbing closet moving to the AC? ",516657378
"haha yeah i mean if we have no other option, but personally i don’t like the idea of the ac having access to all the gear",516657423
"Yeah we really don't like that either ",516657463
"was it res life who said we have to move?",516657501
"So the only thing we'd be asking for is space, and preferably 24/7 access",516657490
"If they want to infringe on our autonomy, we'll definitely have to find another option ",516657517
"Yes ",516657519
"who specifically is taking away the closet? can’t we tell them we need the space and if they take it away they have to provide an alternative",516657537
"also why did no one contact climbing club?",516657556
"they must think its under the jurisdiction of outing club",516657565
"No, they wouldn't have even contacted oc if it wasn't for Stan doing some digging ",516657572
"No one is advocating for climbing club, so they were just going to fuck us ",516657591
"should i send them an aggressive email? As climbing club president? Thats bullshit, they have no respect for these programs its really tiring",516657607
"alright I’m gonna send an email",516657614
"But since they didn't email us, I think that gives us leverage ",516657607
"Sounds good ",516657614
"Stan is aware of our issue now too, so he'll be advocating for us as well as outing club. Especially since we need the climbing club gear for WP ",516657668
"Can I read the drafted email too? ",516657904
"Want to be up to date if I'm gonna be meeting with people",516657928
"Yeah, here",516658055
"￼",516658091
"Can read that?",516658092
"Outing club actually also did not get an email, only WP did ",516658126
"Perfect ",516658157
"Could you send me the wp email?",516658184
"Yeah ",516658948
"ok so the phones are satellite, so anywhere with a clear view of the sky you get service. They cannot call, but can send, receive and view text messages. They can send or receive messages from any cell phone. They have to be activated before you can use them, which is expensive. They have a yearly registration fee, and a monthly activation fee. We registered them right before wp, so its possible that if you call the company, you could convince them to let you activate them for may trip without registering them for another year, and save a little money. So when you activate them, you set them up connect with a person and put in phone numbers for emergency contacts. We used stan and amy for those contacts. The sat phones have an emergency button you can press, which will send medical help to your location and send an emergency message with your location to the emergency contacts. The phones also have an accompanying phone app that people should download. The phone app lets you upload things like topographic maps of the area and makes using the phone easier. You can track where the phones are from the app, or from a computer. The sat phones can record their gps coordinates and other people can view those coordinates from their phone app. I wasn’t on trail so i didn’t actually use them a ton, but I would ask some other trail leaders from last year, or julia and steph, to see how they actually used them on trail. They take a little bit to activate and set up, so you might wanna do that a day or two before hand. Any other questions?! Also how was may trip?!! you have a good time?",516659118
"oh well that email they sent doesn’t sound like they are taking away the closets",516659230
"wow this is a very long message",516659221
"thank you lucas!",516659223
"you wanted it all now you complain come on ",516659245
"but also why is he so butthurt, like the rcd can’t handle that someone actually uses dauten ",516659300
"haha damn administration sucks sometimes",516659318
"that was a celebration",516659342
"not a complaint!!",516659345
haha,516659361
"smiley face",516659350
"also watch out, sometimes stan says things that aren’t really true, or jumps to relatively extreme conclusions. The email he sent us sounds much more extreme than the email sonia forwarded to me from E’quain the rcd. ",516659421
"no worries i guess i got excited who knows",516659572
"He just spent like 30 mins talking to E'guain, so maybe that will shed some light on the matter ",516659925
"Good to keep in mind tho, thanks ",516659931
"Oh good. Like right now he did? Damn wtf is going on haha ",516660012
"lol that's what we're trying to figure out ",516660077
"Also low key getting more gear for climbing club through WP this year ",516661073
"Like another rope, ATCs, lockers, webbing and maybe some draws ",516661100
"I just had a crazy thought! ",516661435
what>!?,516662032
"nice, thatl be great",516662079
"maybe we can organize it next semester so that theres separate ropes only used for wp, with the one jake gave cut in half we probably have enough beater ropes to leave them just for wp",516662122
"Yeah, I just went through all of them for WP inventory ",516662166
"climbing trip this weekend? ",516662199
"hows coloradO? ",516662209
"I'm home, who wants to climb?! ",516662262
"So I wanted to get a stabilizer for my camera so I could start doing some filming and getting practice in. Then I thought I should wait till after camp because I've been wanting to make this music video and had ideas of how to do it in Tustin. But then I thought of filming it in my free time at camp!! It's actually perfect because I have a way cooler setting for scenes I wanted to shoot and I have tons of rad people who probably wouldn't mind being in it",516663085
"I would just shoot bit by bit on off periods and days ",516663206
"Or if that's hard at least make a rad video of us on time off with no storyline haha ",516663242

to me 
I am seriously shocked by the lack of effort you guys seem to put into communicating with people. Between the time I signed up for your mailing list 10 days ago and now, there has been absolutely no information sent out regarding meeting times and places, let alone any advice for new members about preparing for practices. The only information I have received from you at all can be seen in the above two emails, and all I was told was how to buy a membership. When I did buy my membership, I was told that I would be added to an additional mailing list as well as a GroupMe. Did either of those things happen? Of course not. And now, when I reach out to you for any slight bit of information regarding today's practice, I get nothing but silence, even up until the time when the practice was supposed to start, currently 10 minutes ago. Add to this the fact that I've never seen any sort of public advertisement of your group, or seen the method for joining it publicly posted anywhere (the above email doesn't count, since it had to be prompted), and I'm starting the think you don't want to recruit people, and are doing all you can to actively drive prospective members away. I'm not going to demand a refund, since I really do want to participate, but that may change if you guys don't start showing some semblance of actually being a legit group, and not just a way of getting group discounts on memberships.


WU Climbing Club <wuclimbing@gmail.com>
11:12 PM (3 minutes ago)

to Alex 
Alex,

First, I would like to remind you that the wash u climbing club is a student run organization. We are not paid to run the club; it is not our job to sit at the computer replying to emails and we do not check our email every hour. 

Actually, the club is organized by volunteers like myself, who love the sport and the community it fosters. We make an effort to include new people and add to the community of the team. Currently, there are 150 club members and 30+ team members, so you are not the only person who needs attention. 

Now before you start making ""demands"", I want you to pause and consider how you are approaching this situation. Is it possible we made a mistake and missed adding you to the groupMe? Is it possible that we don't check the email an hour before practice because we have other responsibilities? Or is it more likely that we ""doing all we can to actively drive prospective members away"". After tabling to sell memberships for over 6 hours the past few days, and sending several emails about the team, I would disagree with that statement. 

So heres the deal. I will add you to the groupMe and you are encouraged to come to practice on thursday (you aren't the only new member who is interested but missed the first practice). BUT, if you come to participate, your attitude needs to be different. The team is a community that is patient, supportive and respectful. I look forward to having you as a part of the team in a way that is inclusive and positive.

Best,
Lucas",526968973

This isn't a subject I really wanted to breach in the GroupMe because I'm not sure that I'm right, but I was wondering about what Greg said about team members having priority of club members; shouldn't it be more of a dust come first serve basis? Just in terms in fairness and making sure those who want to climb outside and are motivated to don't feel stepped on by priority
Again I don't know if im right which is why I'm texting you oh fearless leader",527707501
"Heyo, it's something we can talk about if you disagree, but how I see it; the people on the team commit to climbing and training together, and (for the most part) have more skills and experience.

The travel policy (whose notes I have attached) presents a lot of problems in line with how we run our trips. There is another meeting about the travel policy (it hasn’t been finalized yet, it’s planning on being implemented in the spring) on Friday, September 29 at 3:00 PM in DUC 276 which i highly recommend someone attends. On that same day at 11 AM, I have scheduled a meeting with Peggy (the person who ran the travel policy meeting tonight) to talk about outing clubs issues with the policy, and am inviting representatives from climbing club to attend.  because the policy is not finalized, the meeting on friday will be largely us providing peggy with information about how our clubs operate so she can take information to the higher ups who actually build the policy. it wont be a problem solving meeting on friday, just a transfer of information about our issues with it as it stands right now",528071072

"Hey loves, wanted to update you. I went with Steph to the hospital yesterday, she's safe, but has been having a harder time with her anxiety and depression lately and to a point where she thought it would be safest for herself to get extra attention. She's at Barnes psych unit till at least Wednesday and has visiting hours from 3-5 and 7-9. If you are free to visit her she said she would be comfy with you coming. The psych unit can be pretty lonely and scary so seeing faces of loved ones like y'all definitely would help. I just got back and will probably go tomorrow at 3 and Cathy at 7 if you want to come along let us know. If you can't make it and wanted to take a few minutes to write a note for her I can bring that along. That would be awesome too because that way she can hold onto it and read it outside of visitors hours when it gets hard. I know you will but just a reminder to keep this info within this group :)",528088001

He has hella work dealing with all the teams so he doesn't climb that much. But we went to j tree last weekend, I finally made it there. It was so awesome. Destroyed my skin but so dope. As for claire she hates me so idk how she's doing except she's not dating radu anymore she has a new bf and I'm dating radu which really pissed her off. Hbu?

"are you guys ok with me submitting this for our project description?",531422903
"We plan to work with Jimmy Xu to create his Interventional Radiology app idea. As discussed in his presentation, the app would serve to eliminate the mental gymnastics that doctors must perform when simultaneously working with patients and looking up at monitors. Using an iPad that can be positioned over the patients body, we can use AR to enhance the process of Radiology procedures.

This is the functionality Jimmy is looking for:

“So the way I was sort of envisioning it is that the image would overlie the area of anatomic interest. For example, if we are interested in placing an abscess drain in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen, we would be focusing our imaging over there. We could place an image target in that area and the app would automatically project an image over there. 

The operator will need some limited ability to manipulate the images. So what frequently happens is that we'll start with a reference image called a ""scout"" over the area. As the procedure progresses more images are taken. So the ability to cache images at another location and recall them over the area of interest as necessary.

Other useful actions would be to rotate the image along its xyz axes and to magnify. If you could play video that would be helpful as well because a lot of the imaging is dynamic as we inject contrast.”",531422904
"lmk if you think we should change/add anything",531422915

"I’m tired to them",532313548
"of them*",532313551
"Yeah I️ get it - it’s not your fault at all. It’s just such a complicated, secretive process that seems to make it as hard as possible for student groups ",532313628
"it just sucks cause I remember trying to get people to go to the showdown and it didn’t work out, then just thinking like fuck I hope we get the showdown funded next time.",532313670
"Was there anything we could have done? Like getting funded for that many people was probably not a bad idea because that way we could ensure that everyone who wanted to complete could but then it also kind of backed us into a corner ",532313934
"Did you explain this to su? ",532313949
yeo,532313951
"yeah i tried",532313955

"Let's build it, I've been wanting to build one at my place but couldn't figure out where. That would be perfect. Can we do it this weekend?",532319533
"Bill seemed to think that the deal was they had to cap the funding because you never explained why we didn’t use the so I’ll comp funding so if we just provide them with that info when we appeal, they can classify it as an extreme circumstance, lift the cap and fund us more ",532320499
"I’m waiting to hear back from him about advice for when we actually do the appeal ",532320524
"We already did an appeal. It was a big pain in the ass",532320543
"Oh and you explained why we didn’t use the funding? ",532320587
yeah,532320592
"no i mean we did an appeal last year",532320617
"but i did explain why we didn’t use the funding this year, I just took too long i guess, it was only a couple days ago",532320637
"Oh you’re saying appeals in general are a pain in the ass ",532320639
yes,532320670
"we had to do one for spring break last yeasr",532320676
"and they made it sound like we wouldn’t have to do one again",532320683
"those fuckers",532320687
"god damnit",532320689
"Well at this point it’s our only option. I️ get that it’s a ton of work so let me help out with it. I️ don’t actually have a super busy rest of the semester so I️ have time to work on it. Also I️ can use bill for advice. ",532320766
"Dude at this point it's more than just an appeal",532320834
"How so? ",532320847
"Because it’s our whole budget? ",532320861
"same old SU huh,",532320878

yep,532320892

idk,532320990
"Odd that they didn’t fund the competitions or the safety gear",532321017
"its cause we didn’t send enough people to the showdown last semester",532321064
"Though they never fund gear, no matter how much I️ play the danger aspect",532321072
"apparently we didn’t spend enough of it",532321074
"so they capped our whole budget",532321082
"Can’t we just appeal for everything? Or at least multiple things? ",532321083
"You didn’t spend all the money?",532321087
"Shit that is always a mistake",532321094
"no way around it",532321098
"we tried a couple things",532321105
"requested a carry forward",532321111
"I️ see",532321111
"tried to spend it on another comp",532321117
"theres really no way to win with fucking su",532321126
"Yeah I️ feel you. Still better than it was with sports club board though",532321154
"Also, one reason they may have not funded the trips is that you labeled them retreats",532321163
"no they said our funding was 100% based on the showdown",532321180
"more or less",532321185
"A club is only allowed one retreat per semester, with funding capped at $15/person",532321192
"Also I️ get it if you don’t want to explain everything to me right now. Especially since you’ve been handling all this and I️ know very little about it",532321205
"at this point i don’t care, I’m tired of dealing with all their shit",532321214
"yeah lets talk about this tmoorrow",532321224
"Sounds good",532321232
"Hey nal! Sorry I missed your FaceTime. I was in a meeting. I really wanna hear about your first day at work but I am super stressed about school stuff right now.

I can definitely talk more tomorrow, but did your day go well? I really hope it was amazing",532323230

:( but let's definitely talk tomorrow",532323922

"Hope Gen will be good at appeals ",532330008

"thanks, I really appreciate the help",532380127
Sure,532381120
"Maybe not after practice because there’s gonna be a ton of people there who will want to participate and it’s probably better if we only have a few people involved. Like no matter what it’s gonna be frustrating because everyone is going to have ideas but you’re the only one who actually understands how it works so if we just have a few of us meeting up, at least at first, it will probably make the process easier, right?

"Sure! Fly him out for a weekend, I’ll pick him up at the airport. When’s his spring break",533330012
"hey il look at it now! I was playing around with stuff, and learned a bit about image rotation, then also played with our idea of detecting the penny to gauge scale",533330093
"this is funny though, so swift has native image processing ability to detect QR codes, rectangles, text and faces. I photoshopped the images to make the penny circle a square, just to test, and spent a ton of time trying to get it to work but could not detect the square. Then just to try it, I photoshopped a little face on top of the square, and that worked really easily haha, so we can for now use facial recognition to detect the scale of our image",533330194
"Oh my god",533330775
"Do you want to do that?",533330783
"haha we could, or we could keep trying to do it with squares",533330808
"I feel like we shouldn’t bc it’s a bit tacky but that’s so so funny ",533330812
"yeah i know",533330819
"Did you read what we put in the doc?",533330828
"No Il look now. but if we could get it working with squares, it’d be a really easy way to be a future project extension. Cause we could put a sticker down and the width and height of it would determine the angle and distance of the scan",533330875
"ok put some comments in",533331824
"Not see about either of those!",533332035
"Welp ",533332671
"Happy thanksgiving lol",533332676
"i put more stuff in",533334680
"Whatcha doin today Lucas?",533337693
"happy thanksgiving!",533337752
"hey buddy!!! I’ve been wanting to text you, but it turned out I have a ton of work to do this break so kinda been bumming around. What are you up to today? Happy tanksgiving!  Im working on some stuff, but if i get it done i could hang out for a bit. We are having friends over for dinner later. Also what are u doing tomorrow?",533339435
"ok Lucas i found where the X-axis angle is!!! If you look on Horos, click on a specific image, click on Meta-Data and scroll down to PositionerPrimaryAngle, it has it!!!!",533340962
"awesome! thats super helpful",533340977
"i have a function that lets you rotate on the x axis",533340989
"If you don’t have horos running, i can put the angle for each image in the doc next to each image, would that be helpful?",533341002
yeah,533341036
"dope ill do that rn",533341042
"then we could adjust the image node thing so that when it takes in an image, it also stores angle",533341052
"also I’m going to email Jimmy to ask if there’s anything in Meta-Data that he thinks might relate to proportions, there are a lot of numbers which I don’t understand. I’m going to guess that there isn’t but it’s worth a shot?",533341113
"Yeah it's worth asking ",533341159
"Can the angle be stored in the image node or do we need a separate array or something to store that?",533341249
"i think it would be dope to store that in the image node object",533341649
"but for permanent saving, elsewhere too",533341664
"No I think the image node would be much better I'm just asking if it's possible ",533341756
ah,533341763
"its possible yeah",533341776
"image nodes have inherent angles, but also the class could store the correct angle, then after rotations, you could put it back to the correct angle",533341799
"angles are up, emailed jimmy",533341992
Cool,533342082

"￼rectangle detection definitely flawed",533344753
"do you think grayscale confuses it?",533344764
"woah but its kinda working awesome! better than i could get",533344769
"hm, try playing with aspect ratio / focal length",533344785
"it would do anything when i just had the dark square",533344786
"it wouldn’t?",533344794
"nope 😕",533344801
hmmm,533344807
"*wouldnt yeah",533344809
"the face one works surprisingly well haha",533344816
"lol its so so funny",533344822
"we could put sproull in there hahaha",533344833
yeah,533344840
"i’m gonna mess around with it more and look for more tutorials, but if this doesn’t work, we could always have the user manually draw the border of the square",533344858
"or tap the 4 corners, even better",533344875
"yeah they could",533344892
"the bummer with the aspect thing is it will change for every angle",533345002
yeah,533345011
"￼read a stack overflow saying that the images needed to be like real life....",533345434
"are you guys okay with moving forward with the user having to tap the 4 corners?",533345443
"no necessarily i think, like i think there are just some variables that affect it",533345456
"but if tapping works, fine by me",533345463
"i’m going to start working on that. it seems v viable",533345481
"the only thing is that we only have the penny images right now. should we have jimmy take new scans with a square shape, or should we run with penny?",533345537
"we can just photoshop squares and then explain how we would do that if we were able to take new scans",533345565

"Hey so not gonna be free today except maybe late, like 10 or 11 after dinner. I'll let you know when dinners done if you're free, and I'm definitely down to hangout tomorrow morning if you can! I leave to fly back around 3",533353683
"￼Look what I found!",533353780
"Do we want to be able to swipe between images in the AR view without going back to the collection view or just leave that out?",533356269

"It would be nice but let’s def put that later in the todo list bc of time restraints",533360576
"I’m around until noonish tomorrow probably!! Down to do something tonight too if ya want but I’m on no real clock so I can bum around tomorrow",533366848
"openCV seems like it works so well from this demo.... https://www.toptal.com/machine-learning/real-time-object-detection-using-mser-in-ios do you think it would work just as well for straight up squares? a dark gray square just kinda seems like not enough to grab on to",533367667
"ok so I’ve been messing around with different way for the user to tap on a square marker to create the shape. We can’t simply use SCNBox because it relies only on a center coordinate and a length and width, which only works if the user perfectly holds the phone above the square marker, and will definitely not work for angled images. I started looking at SCNGeometries and I think they’re our best bet",533370906
"￼",533370914
"the x-y coords are great, but sometimes the z ones aren’t done well",533370930
"￼",533370937
"for example, this is that first photo at a lower angle",533370944
"￼￼",533370956
"but this one on the other hand worked pretty well",533370956
"looked at openCV more, not even going to bother bc it looks like making it work for 3D would be an phD thesis",533371294
"Aren't we just doing it on flat photos, so do we need to use 3D?",533372907
"yeah, 3D is just for sensing where the marker is on the patient pre-operation",533372934
"then after on 2D works for images",533372963
"But they won't be able to see the patient marker because they will be covered with cloth right",533372993
"before they put on the sterile cloth thing, they’d put/secure the marker on the patient’s back or whatever, mark it with the app, then put the cloth on",533373037
"i don’t know how else we would be able to match the markers from the images to real life",533373051
"like positioning wise",533373117
"unless we don’t want to do that? and we just want to get the marker in the image to only sense proportions?",533373134
"i had imagined the marker purpose being twofold, adding both positioning and proportionality",533373230
"anyways 3D detection is working pretty well now, I’m gonna get some shut eye and work on 2D for images tomorrow which should be pretty easy and is prob more important :p",533373428
